        <p>The McDonald's brothers opened their first restaurant on May 15, 1940, in San Bernardino, California. Initially, they served barbecue using a carhop drive-in system. By 1948, they realized hamburgers were their top seller. They closed the original drive-in and introduced a streamlined menu featuring only hamburgers, cheeseburgers, potato chips, coffee, ice cream, soft drinks, and apple pie.</p>
        <p>In 1954, at the age of 52, Ray Kroc invested his life savings to become the exclusive distributor of the Multimixer, a milkshake maker. He learned that a McDonald's stand in California, owned by Dick and Mac McDonald, was using eight Multimixers simultaneously. Intrigued, Kroc traveled to California to see it for himself.</p>
        <p>He was amazed by how efficiently they served so many customers with a limited menu, ensuring quality at every step. Inspired by this model, Kroc suggested opening more restaurants. When the McDonald brothers asked who would take charge, Kroc replied, "What about me?"</p>

            <h3>History of the Big Mac</h3>
            <p>The McDonalds Big Mac originally came out in August of 1968 to feed steel mill workers as the original single patty cheeseburger wasn't filling enough.</p>
            <p>The original Special Sauce for the burger started out as "Secret Sauce" and was actually 2 different sauces that both performed well. 
                The two sauces were combined in 1972 and renamed to "Big Mac Sauce '72". The sauce was then renamed to Special Sauce in 1974. The recipe was changed in 1991 before the original recipe was reinstated in 2004.</p>
